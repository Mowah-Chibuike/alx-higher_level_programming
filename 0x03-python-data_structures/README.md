	- You are not allowed to use global variables
	- No more than 5 functions per file
	- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
	- Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
	- All your header files should be include guarded

Tasks
- Mandatory
	- 0-print_list_integer.py contains a function that prints all integers of a list.
	- 1-element_at.py: contains a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
	- 2-replace_in_list.py: contains a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
	- 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py: contains a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
	- 4-new_in_list.py: contains a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
	- 5-no_c.py: contains a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.
	- 6-print_matrix_integer.py: contains a function that prints a matrix of integers.
